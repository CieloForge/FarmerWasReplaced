A colleciton of scripts created within the game, along with a sort of log for those who want to read and follow along sort of.


## 📖 Overview:

The Farmer Was Replaced is a neat little programming automation game where you the player must program the drone to farm. It uses a python like syntax, **BUT IS NOT PYTHON**. It's simple and fun, and later on challeging to keep efficiency up and maximize things.  I will be slowly adding to this as I play the game and unlock things. 

This isn't really meant to be used as much more than a fun lttle helper for others who own the game, even though it uses a similar syntax to programmig and handles logic based puzzles and such...I wouldn't say its really usbale for interview/recruiter material.
